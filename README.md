CS-320 Software Test Automation & QA

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  To ensure code is functional and secure, best coding practices must be used
throughout development. This is a very broad statement, but ensures that the 
code is consistent between developers, and does not come into existence flawed.
After this, unit tests can be created alongside the main codebase to automatically
check that the code is working as expected. These tests can be reused as the program
becomes more complex to ensure that as changes are implemented, earlier code is
not negatively affected. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Establishing the software requirements is a crucial early phase of development.
Careful attention must be given to the customer as they describe the features
and requirements of the software. Sometimes the customer will be able to explain
and define these requirements, but as they are not experts, the developer must also
think critically about how to best design the software, making choices that will
ensure success and avoid common pitfalls in code development.


How do I approach designing software?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My approach to designing software aims to keep the code simple. The software
should meet the requirements of the customer, and that's it. By keeping code
as organized and simple, it is not only easier to navigate, but also test.
